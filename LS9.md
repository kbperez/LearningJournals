# Learning Journal Day 9

The CSS animation demo was cool but I was so tired I zoned out.

I worked on the index.html style.css for the homepage. Tried to model after last Friday's demo. Did not go so well.  Still need to link to sales.

I added error checking on the sales data page in HTML.  That was cool.
