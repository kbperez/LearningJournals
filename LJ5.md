# Learning Journal Day 5

The weekly review was great.  It helps measure my understanding.

I loved watching the demo and the website come together.

The most frustrating part of the lab 5.  I accidentally forked from the class account.  I didn't realize this would cause me not to be able to merge.  Slowed me down.  The best part was sitting with other students and working on this and sharing thoughts and getting fresh eyes when stuck.  

Another thing I kept forgetting was to pull a new copy of the master to my machine after the merge.  Thank you TAs for your patience.
