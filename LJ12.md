#Learning Journal Day 12 - October 31, 2017


Happy Halloween - the costumes were great.  I even recognized a few of the characters (not the game ones).

Started with code review.  Jeremy had good code.  It helped organize my thought a little about bus-mall.

The new material was about Canvas for drawing (two CodePen demos) and chartjs for putting good looking charts in the DOM.  It's amazing to me that these things are so fully developed and available to all.

A big shout out to the TAs (esp.Bathyu) for holding my hand with getting this project working.  I learned (AGAIN) to start with small function, do one thing well, then worry about the next requirement.  I had to keep relearning this.  Not sure why it doesn't stick.  All my classmates were encourging and told me I could get through it.
