# Learning Journal Day 7

Topics today were the object constructor and writing tables data to the DOM.

After last lab, the object constructor was really exciting to learn about.  Using it and prototype methods seems very logical to me.  The pattern of code should be constructor --> prototype method --> Instantiantion. 

Did a demo in the console writing a table to the DOM. I still have a very limited idea of what I'm doing interactin with the DOM.  Just trying to keep up with what Bryan is doing.

The lab is so much more logical than yesterdays!  I keep forgetting to call functions.  I still have a hard time writing to the DOM.  Figuring out how to access items in object is confusing me now.  My classmates are great and patient. The TAs are patient.  I am much more hopeful today.
