#Learning Journal Day 13 - November 1, 2017


Started with code review.  Jordan's code was what we should aspire to.  I really realized how badly commented and organized mine was. I want to clean up - if I get time (probably not tonight).

The new material was about localStorage.  There is an object on the window which allows string storage.  This is a way to keep track of what is happening in the browser.  It is browswer dependent.  Through Javascript you can add and get elements to this object.
