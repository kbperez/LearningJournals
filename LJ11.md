#Learning Journal Day 11 - October 30, 2017

Started class with a code review of Chocolate Pizza.  This assignment was just work - not too confounding.

Today in class we learned about the HTML <audio> and <video> tags and saw two demos.  Fairly straight-forward.

Much of the rest of the class was spent talking about the Bus Mall project.  The explanations seems straight-forward.  I found (of course) that trying to implement was not so easy.
