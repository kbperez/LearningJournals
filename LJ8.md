# Learning Journal Day 8

Code review replaced with object review.  

Demo of dynamically filled form. Brian types fast - but I kept up and had the style.css done for assignment.  Best looking part of my project.

Problem domain was not clear to me at first.  I probably should read more carefully.

I tried (insert correct word here - refactoring? refining?) code, putting blocks of code for repeated actions in functions.  Still slightly confused on how to call functions but getting better.
