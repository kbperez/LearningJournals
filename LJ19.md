# Learning Journal Day 19 - November 9, 2017

The fourth day of project week was a little unfocused.  I worked on adding a comment page but just on my local branch.  The basic concept (as always) was not too hard, but impleting and styling would, of course, involve updating the app.js and I did not want to mess up the project.
