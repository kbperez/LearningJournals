# Learning Journal Day 6

Topics today were object and the DOM.

Objects seems really useful.  Getting notation right is important.  Use the . to point at object keys(properties).  

Did a demo in CodePen working on the DOM in a dynamic way.

The lab is much more demanding that last week!!  No for-loops in an object unless in a function.  Learning syntax.
