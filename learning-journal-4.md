# Learning Journal Day 4

Functions - seemed easy in lecture, much more tentative when I had to use, still not sure about setting parameters and then passing argument

Display type - default are block and inline, custom is inline-block.  Is inline-block created in CSS

Positioning - absolute and relative - important!; static - default; fixed - header, footer; inherit - don't use.
To make an overlay, make a parent relative and the child absolute.

Floats - don't worry how it works (!).  Use floats to get blocks next to each other.  Use clear once done. Example - define .clearfix {clear: both;} as a class, then call like <div class-"clearfix"> blahhhh</div>

Pull request - in my directory, get someone elses repo and create PR, then close on my machine, work on code, ACP, then ??? the original owner can see and merge if acceptable??

Paired programming lessons - it is hard to read someone else's code!!!  It is hard to keep your hands off the keyboard. 


GITHUB STILL MAKES ME NERVOUS for some reason.
