# Learning Journal Day 18 - November 8, 2017

The third day of project week was continuing to work on stretch features.  I worked on styling the "About Us" page because I needed the practice using CSS.  Worked with hover animation to "reveal" images and played around with positioning.

Complete my first white-boarding experience.  Brian took it easy on me.  Re-enforced my need to practice and understand scoping.
