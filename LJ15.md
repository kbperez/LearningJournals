#Learning Journal Day 15 - November 3, 2017

We pitched our app ideas.  Pretty much all good.  Ended up on the "secret decoder ring" project.

I think this will all come together next week.  My team has jumped right into action, which is good in that I often think too much before acting.  I see a day next week where we have to re-assess, but it's all good now.
