#Learning Journal Day 16 - November 6, 2017

Today was the first day of project week.  My group is going nuts on the CSS - they seem like wizards to me.  Another wizard on encode, decode.  I'm just slogging through hooking up the forms with the guidance of Jeremy.  Feeling hopeful, enjoying the experience.
