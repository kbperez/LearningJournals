#Learning Journal Day 14 - November 2, 2017


This was a fun day.  We had a discussion in the morning about careers.

Next, we all pitched our app ideas.  I thought everyone had a pretty good idea. The pitches were narrowed to 5 teams and we got our team.  The rest of the afternoon was spent talking about the project, getting on the same page, starting a repo and some project management pieces.
